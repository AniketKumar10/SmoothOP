Great! With that in mind, here’s how you can structure your tech stack and the necessary components for the landing page and backend system.

### **1. Frontend (Landing Page)**

- **Next.js**: To handle both the frontend and backend of your landing page, including rendering the profile setup form, resume analysis, and company recommendation features.
  - **React**: For the components of the landing page (profile form, resume upload, etc.).
  - **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the landing page to make it clean, responsive, and user-friendly.
  - **React Dropzone**: For handling file uploads (e.g., uploading resumes).

### **2. Backend (Node.js)**

- **Node.js (with Next.js API routes)**: To handle the server-side logic for:
  - Resume analysis (possibly AI-driven).
  - Profile management (storing and updating user info).
  - Managing job application tracking (listing companies applied to).
  - Retrieving company recommendations from the **company_list** database.
  
- **MongoDB**: For storing:
  - **User Profile Data**: Information like name, contact details, skills, etc.
  - **Job Application Data**: Data for the companies applied to and job positions.
  - **Company List Database**: Contains details of available companies (skills required, positions, etc.).
  
- **Mongoose**: To interact with MongoDB and manage schemas for user profiles, applications, and company recommendations.

### **3. Resume Analysis (AI)**

- **OpenAI API** (GPT-3 or GPT-4): For analyzing resumes and providing insights, such as skill matching, strengths, or even suggestions for improvement based on job descriptions.
  
- **Text Extraction Libraries**: To extract text from resumes (e.g., PDFs), using libraries like **pdf-lib** or **pdf2json** for text parsing.

---

### **4. Company Recommendation System**

- **Company List Database**: Store all company data, including skills required, job roles, and descriptions. The system will analyze the user’s skills and recommend companies based on skill matching.
  
- **Skill Matching Algorithm**: Use a simple matching algorithm (e.g., cosine similarity) to compare user skills with the company list and suggest the best job matches.

---

### **5. Authentication & Security (Optional)**

- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: For user authentication and managing secure login sessions.

---

### **6. Hosting & Deployment**

- **Vercel**: Deploy the Next.js landing page and backend APIs easily.
- **MongoDB Atlas**: For cloud-hosted MongoDB, accessible from anywhere.

---

### **7. Testing & Debugging**

- **Jest**: For unit testing backend logic, such as resume analysis and profile management.
- **Cypress**: For end-to-end testing of the landing page and user interactions.

---

### **Flow Overview**:
1. **Profile Setup**: The user visits the landing page, creates a profile (entering basic details and skills), and uploads their resume.
2. **Resume Analysis**: The resume is analyzed (AI-driven) to extract key information and skills, which are then stored in the user’s profile.
3. **Company Recommendations**: Based on the skills provided, the user will receive company recommendations from the company list database.
4. **Job Application Tracking**: Users can track which companies they have applied to, saving the links and application details.

This flow should allow your users to have a seamless experience when they land on the page, set up their profile, and get value from the AI-driven resume analysis and company recommendations.
