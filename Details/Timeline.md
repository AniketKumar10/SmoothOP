#### **Phase 4: Global Job Recommendations System (Post-Launch)**
- **Tasks**:
  - Build the job recommendations system to suggest job openings to global users based on stored links and posting dates (this feature will be added in a future release).

**Time Estimate**: **Post-launch**

#### **Phase 5: Testing & Deployment (1–2 Weeks)**
- **Tasks**:
  - Perform QA testing for Chrome support and core features.
  - Optimize the extension for speed and usability.
  - Deploy the extension on the Chrome Web Store.
  - Gather user feedback from beta testing to refine the final product.

This plan focuses on delivering an **MVP with core features** (auto-fill, file upload, job tracking, job description analysis, etc.) while prioritizing **Chrome compatibility**. The global job recommendations system and broader cross-browser support will follow after the initial launch.
